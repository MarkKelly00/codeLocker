## Deployment
Check out the deployment: [https://codel0cker.herokuapp.com/](https://codel0cker.herokuapp.com/)

## Installation

Dependancies:
1. Open the development folder and begin by running the command "npm i".  
2. After those installations have ran, cd into the client folder and run the command "npm i". 

Next we need to check the development settings: 
1. In server.js, remove "process.env.MONGODB_URI ||" if it is there. 
2. in routes/api/.index.js comment out lines 7-9 if they are not already. 
3. in components/Auth0/Auth/providerWithHistory.js set "http://localhost:3000/dashboard" as the redirectUri on line 19. 

To start the application, cd into the Develop folder and run npm start.

## Usage

#### The Splash Page

<img width="600" alt="CodeLocker Splash" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62780709/96330951-1dc57b00-100e-11eb-878d-b30a4239894b.png">

When you arrive at the CodeLocker Splash page, there is a code editor for you to try writing and running a code snippet.  Click inside the code editor, write a javascript function and click run to show your result in the output window below the code editor.  To clear the code editor, you can click the reset button.  To save your Code Snippet, click the save button.  If you have an account, your code snippet will be saved.  If you do not, you will be prompted to create an account or log in.  To log in or sign up for a free account with CodeLocker, click the log in or sign up button to be redirect to the Log In or Sign Up page.

#### The Dashboard

<img width="600" alt="CodeLocker Dash" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62780709/96331144-c1fbf180-100f-11eb-9376-68f512d26570.png">

After loggin in or signing up, you will be directed back to the Dashboard.  The Dashboard is the heart of CodeLocker and is where most of the functionality lives.  Let's get familiar with the dashboard.  

##### The Code Editors

<img width="600" alt="CodeLocker Editors" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62780709/96330945-100ff580-100e-11eb-8024-3698268846d4.png">

In the main window, you will see two code editors side by side.  The left code editor is a read-only editor.  This is where you will view Code Snippets retrieved from your locker and and view public Code Snippets other members have saved in the public locker.  From here you can run the code by clicking the run button below the editor.  You can "like" the current code snippet by clicking the like button.  You can copy the Snippet by clicking the copy button and then paste it into the right editor.  There is also a share button if you would like to email a code snippet to someone.  The right code editor is where Code Snippets can be written, modified and saved to your locker.  This is where you will be creating or pasting in Code Snippets that you want to save.  Code can be written from scratch here or pasted in from another source and tested.  You can also copy and paste Code Snippets from the read-only editor into this code editor to be modified and saved.  At any time, you can click into the title input field and name your Code Snippet.  Once you are happy with the Code Snippet and are ready to save it, it is time to decide whether we want it to be shared with the CodeLocker community or saved privately.  If you would like the Snippet to be private and not viewed or accessed by others, click on the Keep Private toggle switch.  Once this has been decided, click the save button and it will be saved to your locker.  

##### Main CodeLocker Table

<img width="600" alt="CodeLocker Main Table" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62780709/96331163-eeb00900-100f-11eb-9644-13417d80434e.png">

Below the code editors, is the main CodeLocker table.  This is an easy and convenient place to retrieve code Snippets.  Code Snippets that have been saved will show up here and can be filtered using the filter by toggle at the top right hand of the table.  Click on the filter by toggle and choose to show All Users, My CodeLocker or Favorites.  All Users will populate all public Code Snippets.  My CodeLocker will show all saved Code Snippets of the current user who is logged in.  Favorites will show only Code Snippets that have been favorited by the user. At any time, you can click on the column header titles to organize the table by user, title, date modified, favorites and likes.  

To view a Code Snippet, click on the Title of the Snippet and it will populate in the read-only code editor.

##### The Sidebar

<img width="256" alt="CodeLocker SideBar" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62780709/96330940-0be3d800-100e-11eb-9cf5-85ed8c42ba32.png">

The sidebar is located on the left side of the screen and is a static window making it easy to access at all times while using the site.  At the top of the side bar is your profile name and image and a quick link to the profile page.  Under your profile image, you can navigate to your personal locker, the about us page and the faq page by clicking the corresponding buttons.  There is also a short list of your favorite Snippets in the sidebar.  This allows you to quickly access your most used or favorite Snippets.

##### Search Field

<img width="407" alt="CodeLocker Search" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62780709/96330937-08505100-100e-11eb-8c28-0b5295b9889c.png">

At any time, you can type a query into the search field at the top or the page.  This field will search the body of Code Snippets and show all Snippets that contain that query.  For example, if you wanted to find a Code Snippet that used "array.length" you would type that in the search and return all Code Snippets with "array.lenghth" in the code body.

and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

#### Our Standards

#### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

#### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

#### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[INSERT CONTACT METHOD].
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

#### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

##### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
